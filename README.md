ahopoll
=======

service for making polls  
crapped this out in like 1 weekend so don't expect much  
too lazy to find hosting for it so do whatever you want  

features:  
no javascript required for creating, voting, and viewing results  
anonymous creation and voting  
IPs are hashed with bcrypt and a unique salt for each poll  
poll ids are random, you won't be able to get to them by randomly guessing  
set timeout limits and hide results until the poll expires  
multiple questions per poll  
allow a custom number of choices for each question  
allow write in choices for each question  
interactive page to view cross option and cross question statistics  
interactive page to view a line graph of votes (this page is shit, don't use it)
