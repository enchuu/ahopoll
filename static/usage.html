<h2>How to enter questions</h2>

<p>Each block of text forms a question. Blocks of text are seperated by 2 newlines.<br><br>The first line is always the "question" you are asking. The next line can specify how many options are allowed to be selected. Enter 1 number to require exactly that amount of options. Enter 2 numbers seperated by a comma to allow a range of options between the 2 numbers. If you skip this, then the default is set to 1. The max amount of options a question can have is 250.<br><br>The next lines will specify the original options for the question. If you want to allow write in votes, add a * as the final line.</p>
